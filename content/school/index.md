### Bachelor thesis

Objective of this work is to describe utilization of *R* programming language forpresentation of data, algorithms, measurement results and simulation experiments. Frameworks *Shiny* and *knitr*, used for creation of reactive web applications and reproducible reports, respectively, are presented for this purpose. Usage of these tools is demonstrated on several exercises from different domains, such as general data analysis, computational geometry or molecular simulations.

[Example app 1 - Sierpinski simplex (using XOR)](https://ctibor.shinyapps.io/Xorpinski/)

[Example app 2 - Ising model](https://ctibor.shinyapps.io/ising/)

[Example app 3 - K-means clustering](https://ctibor.shinyapps.io/kmeans/)

[Example app 4 - Delaunay interfaces](https://ctibor.shinyapps.io/delaunay/)

### Diploma thesis

This diploma thesis concerns itself with analysis and quantification of reduction of errors and vulnerabilities in software implemented in Rust programming lanmguage. Rust is modern systems programming language competing with C and C++. Compared to these languages it offers protection against common memory management bugs (buffer overflow, use after free, double free, etc). Although Rust's advantages seem intuitive, currently there is little to no data examining real world programs and actually quantifying how much - if at all - Rust improves efforts to create safer systems. This work is dedicated to performing such research.
